There once was a man named Cleave, he lived in Emerald Ranch in a rickety old 
farmhouse. Cleave has a wife, Darlene, and two small children, Jim and Verona.
Although Cleave loved his wife and kids, he didn't make much money as a farmer
and preferred to spend the little free time he had at the local train station,
playing dominoes with his friend Willie. The buy in was low, so Cleave played
many games, sometimes losing lots of money. But this didn't bother Cleave.
