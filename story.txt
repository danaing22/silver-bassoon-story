There once was a man named Cleave, he lived in Emerald Ranch in a rickety old 
farmhouse. Cleave has a wife, Darlene, and two small children, Jim and Verona.
Although Cleave loved his wife and kids, he didn't make much money as a farmer
and preferred to spend the little free time he had at the local train station,
playing dominoes with his friend Willie. The buy in was low, so Cleave played
many games, sometimes losing lots of money. But this didn't bother Cleave. 

After a long day of work Cleave entered the train station, ready to play. The
games seemed to fly by and soon it had become 2AM. Cleave got up to leave, but
was stoped by the owner. Cleaver, drunk, tried to rush past him but that did
not work. The owner told him that he had bet and lost more money than he could
pay. Cleave stood there unsure of what he should do.
